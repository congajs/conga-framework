## The Service Container

The Conga Framework provides a Dependency Injection Service Container which allows service classes,
objects, and functions to be registered and retrieved.

When your application is booted, the services are loaded and registered to the main container based
on their service configurations found in the application's bundles.

## Creating and Using a Service

Suppose you have the following class and would like to expose it as a service that is automatically
instantiated and available to use within your application:

```javascript
// create a service in my-bundle/lib/services/MyService.js

module.exports = class MyService {

    /**
     * Say something nice
     *
     * @return {String}
     */
    sayHello() {
        return 'Hello World';
    }
}
```

Add the service definition config to your bundle's services.yml file by providing the namespaced path
to your service:


```yaml
# my-bundle/lib/resources/config/services.yml

services:

    my.service:
        constructor: "@my-bundle:services/MyService"
```

Now you will be able to retrieve the service instance from wherever the service container is available:

```javascript
// retrieve the service from a controller action

/**
 * @Route("/hello")
 */
hello(req, res) {

    const service = this.container.get('my.service');

    res.return({
        hello: service.sayHello()
    });
}
```
