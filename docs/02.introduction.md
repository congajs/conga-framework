## Overview

The Conga Framework provides a concrete structure to organize, modularize, and add functionality
to projects. The core concept of the framework is dividing functionality in to modules known
as "bundles". Each bundle is a self contained library which contains the configuration, classes, public assets,
etc. which are then registered to the main application.

The @conga/framework module is in itself a bundle which get's registered to your application and
provides basic controller routing, application and request lifecycle hooks, logging, and view handlers.
